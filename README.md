# Project-6
rangular 

This project evaluates the objects for rangular in terms of modules with data structures using linked lists for objects that can grow to a large size.  A module for parameters of the code is used as well as variables that define the size of objects for a specific case.  The parameters included may increase as GRASP applications are developed. 

rang_objects1.f90 are evaluated for use in the rangular application.
